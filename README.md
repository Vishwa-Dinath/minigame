## Description
This is a simple mini game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player controls a boy character who must navigate through a zombie-infested environment, attack zombies, run forward, and jump. The objective of the game is to reach the destination and win the game.

## Gameplay
The player can control the boy character using the following keyboard inputs:
- **Left Arrow**: Move the character left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the character right.
- **Spacebar**: Make the character jump.
- **MouseClick**: Attack zombies.

The boy character must navigate through while avoiding contact with the zombies. If the character collides with a zombie, the game is over and the player must restart the level. Additionally, the character can attack zombies by right clicking the mouse, eliminating them from the game.

To win the game, the player must guide the boy character to the destination. The game continues until loses by coming into contact with a zombie.
